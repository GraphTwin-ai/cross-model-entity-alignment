# Cross-Model Entity Alignment 🚀

## 🔍 Project Overview
Cross-Model Entity Alignment is an AI-driven project focused on **aligning entities between RDF graphs and Property Graphs (PGs)**. Using **transformer-based encoders** and **contrastive learning**, we aim to generate **highly accurate vector representations** of graph entities and establish meaningful mappings between them.

## 🛠️ Key Features
- **Dual Graph Representation**: Supports RDF triples and Property Graph structures.
- **Transformer-Based Encoding**: Converts graphs into vector spaces for comparison.
- **Contrastive Learning**: Enhances entity alignment via similarity optimization.
- **Graph-to-Graph Mapping**: Creates a structured mapping between RDF and PG entities.

## 📌 How It Works
1. **Pretrain Encoders**: Train individual models for RDF and PG representations.
2. **Fine-Tune with Contrastive Loss**: Optimize similarity scores for aligned entities.
3. **Entity Matching**: Identify equivalent nodes across both graph formats.
4. **Evaluate Alignment**: Measure accuracy with standard metrics.
